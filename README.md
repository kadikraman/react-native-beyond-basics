# Intermediate React Native Course

Welcome to my Intermediate React Native course, I hope you'll enjoy it! See the course website [here](https://kadikraman.github.io/react-native-beyond-basics/).

## About the course

The material in the course follows on from the material from the [Intro to React Native](https://kadikraman.github.io/react-native-v2/)
course. You don't _have_ to take that course course, but we will assume familiarity with some of the core concepts:

- the basic components: `View`, `Text`, `TouchableOpacity`, `FlatList`, `ScrollView`
- styling your components using `StyleSheet`
- navigation using `react-navigation`
- `useState`, `useEffect` and `useCallback` hooks
