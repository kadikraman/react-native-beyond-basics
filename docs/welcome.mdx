# Welcome

Hi there! Thank you for your interest in this intermediate React Native course! 🎉

## About Me

My name is **Kadi Kraman**, and I am a **Principal Engineer** at [Formidable](https://formidable.com/) where I build things in JavaScript, primarily with React Native. I've been doing web dev with React since 2015 and React Native since 2017. I have been extremely fortunate to have been involved with several exciting end to end React Native projects or the years and I'm excited to share come of the things I've learnt along the way.

Find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kadikraman), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kadi-kraman-922a7277/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/kadikraman).

## Target Audience

The material in the course follows on from the material from the [Intro to React Native](https://kadikraman.github.io/react-native-v2/)
course. You don't _have_ to take that course course, but we will assume familiarity with some of the core concepts:

- the basic components: `View`, `Text`, `TouchableOpacity`, `FlatList`, `ScrollView`
- styling your components using `StyleSheet`
- navigation using `react-navigation`
- `useState`, `useEffect` and `useCallback` hooks

## What You'll Need

In this course, we will _not_ be using Expo. That's right, we're going fully native! This means that if you want to build an iOS app, you _must_ use a Mac since iOS apps cannot be built on Windows or Linux.

Aside from that restriction, feel free to follow this on Android or iOS (or both of course!) - instruction and examples will be provided for both platforms.

I will be using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) code editor, iPhone 12 simulator and an Android Nexus Emulator throughout.

## Course Guide

Throughout the course - usually at the end of a page - you'll see blue banners that look like this:

These are checkpoint that show the code that was just added. You can use these to check your work!

## What we'll build

By the end of this course, you will have built your own mood picker app.
